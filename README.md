# SharedChatRoom â€“ Real-Time Chat App

A full-stack real-time chat web application built with React on the frontend and Node.js + WebSocket + MongoDB on the backend. 
It supports multiple concurrent users, stores messages in the database, and reflects messages in real time across all connected clients.
# NOTE: As the backend is hosted on a Free Render Instance, and may sleep after inactivity. If you see "Status: Disconnected" or errors at first, please wait for ~30-60 seconds. The server will automatically wake up, and chat will start working

# Architecture Overview
--Frontend--
- Built with React+Vite
- Components:
  - UserPromot - enter username
  - ChatWindow - shows chat history
  - MessageInput - send new messages
- Uses native WebSocket API to connect to the backend
- Listens for incoming messages and updates the chat window dynamically

--Backend--
- Built with Node.js and ws Websocket Library
- Manages:
  -Live user connections
  -In-memory chat history

--

# Concurrency Handling and Frontend-Backend Communication
- Each user connection is handled asynchronously
- Messages are broadcast in real time
- Backend can support multiple concurrent users without blocking
- React and Node communicate using WebSocket Protocol non-traditional HTTP protocol

--

# Assumptions & Design Choices
- No authentication - open username-based login (authentication is a future scope)
