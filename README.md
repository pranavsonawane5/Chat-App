# Architecture Overview
--Frontend--
- Built with React+Vite
- Components:
  - UserPromot - enter username
  - ChatWindow - shows chat history
  - MessageInput - send new messages
- Uses native WebSocket API to connect to the backend
- Listens for incoming messags and updates chat window dynamically

--Backend--
- Built with Node.js and ws Websocket Library
- Manages:
  -Live user connections
  -In-memory chat history

# Concurrency Handling and fronend backend communication
- Each user connection is handled asynchronously
- messages are broadcast in real time
- Backend can support multiple concurrent users without blocking
- React and Node communicate with using Websocket Protocols non traditional HTTP protocol

# Assumptions & Design Choices
- No authentication - open username based login (authentication is future scope)

# Accessing the Deployed App
